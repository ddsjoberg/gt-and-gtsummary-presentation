# {gt} package

???
- gt is the grammar of graphics

- package from Rstudio

- seeks to create a unifying code base for HTML, PDF, and RTF output

- HTML and PDF are great. RTF is getting close
---
# {gt} philosophy
.large[
"We can construct a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts. These include the *table header*, the *stub*, the *stub head*, the *column labels*, the *table body*, and the *table footer*."
]
<p align="center"><img src="images/gt_parts_of_a_table.png" width=60%></p>

???

- package has sets of functions for modifying each piece of a table

- we'll review the most common/useful
---
# {gt} installation

.large[
- {gt} is not yet released on CRAN.

- Use the code below to install from GitHub.
]
```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("rstudio/gt")
```

.large[
- While you're at it, install {gtsummary} as well.
]
```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ddsjoberg/gtsummary")
```

.large[
- There is a version of {gtsummary} on CRAN, but with limited functionality.

- Will be released on CRAN after {gt} is released.

# {gt} examples: the data

.large[When used alone, the `gt()` function prints a data frame. But so much more is possible!]

.pull-left[

- the most common and useful is gt()

- gt() is the first function to run, required every time

???

- Remember this trial_summary object.  We're using it for the next few slides

- the raw print is not pretty

- we can add formatting, here we format columns with `fmt_number()`

- we don't have to create character versions of our columns!  wonderful!

- use `vars()` because we can seletct mutliple columns.  Also accepts character vector of names

.pull-right[.large[
- Use the `rows = ` argument to pinpoint a cell to format.

- There are many formatting functions available: `fmt_percent()`, `fmt_currency()`, `fmt_date()`, `fmt_time()`, `fmt_missing()`, and more.

- You can write your own function and pass it to `fmt()` to format a table.
]]

???

- the `fmt_number()` function can also used to format a single cell

- lots of formatting functions to choose from

# {gt} examples: grouping data

- some functions from biostatR v0.1 have been exported to mskR

- mskR and biostatR are both undergoing an uncoupling.

- biostatR will comprise of these three packages

- biostatR won't fully undergo the uncoupling until {gt} is released (or their RTF output is improved)

1. Create a {gtsummary} table.

1. Convert the table to a {gt} object with the `as_gt()` function.

- This table is ready for publication!

- That is something no other package I know of can do

- The back end for the function is {broom} and {gt}, meaning that there is broad support for most regression model types, and the resulting tables are gorgeous and customizable.

- Common regression models, such as logistic regression and Cox regression, are automatically identified and the tables are created with appropriate headers. 

- Resulting tables can be merged (i.e. side-by-side tables for models with the same predictors and different outcomes).  

- Tables can also be stacked on top of one another.

- build the regression model on your own....we are not in the business of model estimation or checking

If there is time, review the structure of a {gtsummary} object

Essentially, what is going on is that the {gt} calls on the right are called on the table on the left whenever the object is printed.

Understanding this structure will help you modify if you need.  If there is a {gt} call that formats in a way you don't like, convert your object with `as_gt()` and use the `omit =` argument to leave out the gt call you don't like.

You can replace it with whatever you choose.
